# Minesweeper Game - Lightning Web Components (LWC)

A fully functional Minesweeper game built using Lightning Web Components (LWC). The game follows the classic Minesweeper rules with three difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert. Each game grid is randomly generated, and players must reveal all non-mine cells to win.

## Features
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Beginner**: 9x9 grid with 10 mines.
  - **Intermediate**: 16x16 grid with 40 mines.
  - **Expert**: 30x16 grid with 99 mines.
- **Flagging**: Right-click to flag cells that you suspect contain mines.
- **Recursive Reveal**: Automatically reveals empty cells and their neighbors.
- **Game Over Detection**: If a mine is clicked, the game ends and all mines are revealed.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically checks if all non-mine cells are revealed, declaring the player a winner when conditions are met.
- **Restart Option**: After finishing or stopping a game, players can restart and select a new difficulty level.

## How to Play
1. **Select a Difficulty**: Click one of the difficulty buttons to start a new game.
    - Beginner: 9x9 grid with 10 mines.
    - Intermediate: 16x16 grid with 40 mines.
    - Expert: 30x16 grid with 99 mines.
2. **Reveal a Cell**: Click on a cell to reveal it.
   - If the cell contains a mine, the game is over and all mines are revealed.
   - If the cell does not contain a mine, it will show the number of adjacent mines.
3. **Flag a Cell**: Right-click (or long-press on mobile) on a cell to flag it as suspected of containing a mine.
4. **Win the Game**: Reveal all non-mine cells to win. If you have successfully revealed all safe cells, the game will automatically declare you the winner.
